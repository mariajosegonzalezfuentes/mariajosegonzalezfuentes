## About Me

I am a PhD candidate in Economics at [ENS Lyon](https://www.ens-lyon.fr/en/) and the Center for Economic Research on Governance, Inequality and Conflict [(CERGIC)](https://www.cergic-lyon.fr/). 

I am supervised by Professor [Sophie Hatte](https://sites.google.com/site/sophiehatte/).

My research interests are in gender economics, with a focus on the intersection between gender and political economy. I am also interested in experimental economics.

Before starting my PhD I was a pre-doc at INSEAD and a Research Assistant at the Women in Business Chair from Sciences Po (LIEPP). 

I hold a Master's degree in Analysis and Policy in Economics from the Paris School of Economics (PSE).
