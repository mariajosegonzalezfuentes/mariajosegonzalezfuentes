# María José González-Fuentes

I am an Economics PhD candidate at the [ENS de Lyon](https://www.ens-lyon.fr/en/) and the [Center for Economic Research on Governance, Inequality and Conflict (CERGIC)](https://www.cergic-lyon.fr/) working under the supervision of [Sophie Hatte](https://sites.google.com/site/sophiehatte/).

My research interests are in gender economics, with a focus on the intersection between gender economics and political economy. I am also interested in experimental economics.

Before starting my PhD I was a pre-doc at INSEAD and a Research Assistant at the Women in Business Chair from Sciences Po (LIEPP). I hold a Master's degree from the Paris School of Economics (PSE).
