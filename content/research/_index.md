**Discrimination, Rejection, and Application Behavior: Effects of Blind Hiring Processes**, joint with Anne Boring, Katie B. Coffman and Dylan Glover _(draft coming soon!)_  

Blind hiring processes are one of the main policies that organizations use to reduce biases at the hiring stage. We examine demand-side, supply-side, and net effects of blinding information about gender and age in applications in the context of an online survey experiment. We assign participants to the role of recruiter or job candidate. We examine recruiters' willingness to hire candidates under a blind or a non-blind hiring process. Next, we examine candidates' willingness to apply under a blind and a non-blind hiring process. Then, we ask candidates to what factors would they attribute recruiters' decisions to either hire or not hire them. We relate these beliefs to recruiters' actual discrimination on the market. Finally, we examine whether rejection and the reasons that job seekers attribute to rejection impact their willingness to apply to a new job opportunity.

**Gender Quotas, Campaign Financing Rules and Party Bias against Women in Brazil**, joint with Luc Paluskiewicz _(draft coming soon!)_  

In spite of a three-decades affirmative action campaign, women continue to be underrepresented in the political arena in Brazil. This paper examines whether party bias and strategic nomination patterns undermine the positive effects of two reforms on gender quotas and campaign financing rules. Focusing on local elections, we consider these changes in the electoral rules as quasi-natural experiment and estimate their effect in a difference-in-differences setting using fine electoral data. Our analysis shows that, while political parties comply with the new electoral rules, they do so strategically in terms of their political advantage and the degree of competitiveness within each municipality. By comparing politically competitive and non-competitive municipalities, we demonstrate that party nomination choices consistently disadvantage women and reduces their likelihood of being elected. Importantly, our findings reveal that these nomination strategies vary significantly based on the level of political advantage each party had accumulated prior to the reforms.
