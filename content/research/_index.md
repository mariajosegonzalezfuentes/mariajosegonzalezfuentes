We examine job candidates' demand for blind hiring processes, both in initial applications and following the rejection of an application. Participants in an online survey experiment are assigned to the role of either a recruiter or a candidate for a job opportunity that requires coding and programming skills. Candidates provide their willingness to apply for the job opportunity with a non-blind resume, which shows information about gender and age, or a blind resume which hides this information. Recruiters provide their willingness to hire candidates with either non-blind or blind resumes. We find that women and older subjects are less willing to apply. The gap in WTA is driven by candidates who expect discrimination. Following rejection, WTA drops.

In spite of a three-decades affirmative action campaign, women continue to be underrepresented in the political arena in Brazil. This paper examines whether party bias and strategic nomination patterns undermine the positive effects of two reforms on gender quotas and campaign financing rules. Focusing on local elections, we consider these changes in the electoral rules as quasi-natural experiment and estimate their effect in a difference-in-differences setting using fine electoral data. Our analysis shows that, while political parties comply with the new electoral rules, they do so strategically in terms of their political advantage and the degree of competitiveness within each municipality. By comparing politically competitive and non-competitive municipalities, we demonstrate that party nomination choices consistently disadvantage women and reduces their likelihood of being elected. Importantly, our findings reveal that these nomination strategies vary significantly based on the level of political advantage each party had accumulated prior to the reforms.
